Proyects about Machine Learning and Deep Learning

In the proyects our work is:

1- Bank_account_prediction.ipynb:
  - In this proyect our work is predict if a client gonna close his account or not, using ML predictions

2- Diabetes_DeepLearning.ipynb:
  - This proyect consists in predict with the medical data if a pacient can have diabetes or not.

3- Heart_Failure_Prediction.ipynb:
  - With the treatment of this data our work is predict if a patient suffers a heart attack and can survive it.
 
4- Images-cnn:
  - This is a basic proyect to train and test an basic CNN with images where the model is created with tensorflow using a binary classification

5- Proyecto_ML_Idealista.ipynb:
  - This proyect is special for me cause i stract the data myself and create a ML algorithm and test diferents models using from linear regression classify using tree    models
